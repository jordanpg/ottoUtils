	\c6Used to create a report on a specific player.
	\c6Upon using the command, you will be prompted for a title.
	\c6The title is a subject line, giving a very brief summary of the event.
	\c6After giving a title, you will be asked to provide a more detailed summary.
	\c3Keep in mind you only have \c5@v(|$ottoUtils::MaxLines|) \c3line@v(|($ottoUtils::MaxLines == 1 ? "" : "s")|) to work with!
	\c6There are also some control commands in report mode. To use these, just do ![cmd] while making a report.
